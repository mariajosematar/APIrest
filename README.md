# Build a REST API with Node.js, Express, and MySQL

## Prerequisites :nerd_face:	 : 
- Understanding of how MySQL and relational databases work in general
- Basic knowledge of Node.js and Express.js
- Understanding of what REST (representational state transfer) APIs are and how they function
- Knowledge of what CRUD (create, read, update, delete) is and how it relates to the HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE

### Table of contents:

- Create the programming languages table
- Add demo rows for programming languages
- Setting up Express.js for our REST API
- REST API project structure
- GET popular programming languages
- POST a new programming language
- PUT to update an existing programming language
- DELETE a programming language
- Testing our APIs

#### Conclusion:

- We have a working API server that uses Node.js and MySQL.

- In this repository, you will find how to configure MySQL in a free service (https://db4free.net/). We then create an Express.js server that can handle various HTTP methods regarding how it is translated to SQL queries.

- The sample REST API in this repository serves as a good starting point and foundation for building real-world production-ready REST APIs.
