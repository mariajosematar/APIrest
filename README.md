# Build a REST API with Node.js, Express, and MySQL

## Prerequisites: 
Understanding of how MySQL and relational databases work in general
Basic knowledge of Node.js and Express.js
Understanding of what REST (representational state transfer) APIs are and how they function
Knowledge of what CRUD (create, read, update, delete) is and how it relates to the HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE

### Table of contents:

Create the programming languages table
Add demo rows for programming languages
Setting up Express.js for our REST API
REST API project structure
GET popular programming languages
POST a new programming language
PUT to update an existing programming language
DELETE a programming language
Testing our APIs

#### Conclusion:

We have a working API server that uses Node.js and MySQL.

In this repository, you will find how to configure MySQL in a free service (https://db4free.net/). We then create an Express.js server that can handle various HTTP methods regarding how it is translated to SQL queries.

The sample REST API in this repository serves as a good starting point and foundation for building real-world production-ready REST APIs.
